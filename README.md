# My Little Book App

**Author**: Jennifer Williams Piper and Josiah Green
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This is an app that shows the user a list of books, with the option to choose a book and read more about it.

## Getting Started
Users need to install required packages specified in package.json including express, postgress, cors and bodyparser.

## Architecture

Book data is stored in a SQL database. 
server.js pulls book data from the database and passes it to the browser to be displayed on the web page.
The front end is deployed on GitHub Pages. The back end is deployed on Heroku.
